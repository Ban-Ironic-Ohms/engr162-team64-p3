# HEADER
# Desc: This file serves as a way for logic to control the rover. It provides 
# simple functions like forward and turn that are highly customizable (speed, 
# power, angles, etc.). It also has a function allStop() that immediatly stops
# all motors. This is most useful in the case of motors running erradically

# ---------- IMPORTS ---------- #
import time
import brickpi3
import grovepi
from script.calibrationVariables import LargeLegoMotor, SmallLegoMotor

# ---------- INITIALIZATION ---------- #
BP = brickpi3.BrickPi3()

L_MOTOR_PORT = BP.PORT_B
R_MOTOR_PORT = BP.PORT_C


T_MOTOR_PORT = BP.PORT_A

all_motors = [L_MOTOR_PORT, R_MOTOR_PORT, T_MOTOR_PORT]

# ---------- GLOBAL VARIABLES ---------- #
BASE_SPEED = 10

turn_state = 0


# ---------- FUNCTIONS ---------- #

# These functions run the left and right motors.

# This function can either take a position (cm) for the robot to travel and/or
# a speed (cm/s) for it to travel at. Default speed is 15 cm/s

    # keeps a state for current turn direction so we can work relativly across multiple function calls
